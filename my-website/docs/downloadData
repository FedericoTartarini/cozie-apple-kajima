## Download the data collected using the Cozie Apple survey

You can download the data you have collected using the Cozie Apple survey using the following Python code.
Please note that you will have to specify few variables before using the following code.
In particular, you will have to specify your `USER_ID` and `API_KEY`.
You can access those information by emailing us at cozie.app@gmail.com
The code will print only the latest five rows of data you have queried from the database.

```
YOUR_TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Singapore'
USER_ID = 'XXXXXXX'
WEEKS = "10"
API_KEY = 'k6iy7nxkBn9hTvScq2vHV8qhXMLl95oA2zlNdA8h'

payload = {'user_id': USER_ID, 'weeks': WEEKS}

# the api-key below is limited to 200 queries per day. Please contact us to get an API key
headers = {"Accept": "application/json", 'x-api-key': API_KEY}

response = requests.get( 'https://0iecjae656.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/CozieApple_Read_Influx', params=payload, headers=headers)
my_json = response.content.decode('utf8').replace("'", '"')
data = json.loads(my_json)
df = pd.read_json(data[1]['data']).T
df.index = df.index.tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert(YOUR_TIMEZONE)

df.head()
```

Please contact Federico Tartarini if you have any feedback, suggestions or if you experience any bugs with the application.
Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
